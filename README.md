# Random-Movie-Generator-2.0

This was a project made for the individual hackday in the Salt´s Program where we were asked to use dotnet web API for backend and React for frontend,
and store the information in a MySQL database. This was done in ≈ 10 hours and it´s a Random Movie Generator that chooses a random movie out of the catalog,that is information stored in the database, and you can add your movie to the catalog(database) using the Add feature.
